### Sentinel IDS – Power, Precision, and Proactive Defense.
The future of cybersecurity intelligence starts here.
### Real-Time Threat Detection

### Continuously monitors network traffic,
### identifying malicious activity in milliseconds.

### Hybrid Detection Engine leveraging both signature-based and AI-driven anomaly detection for 99.9% accuracy.

### Threat intelligence feeds automatically update to recognize the latest attack patterns.


### Smart Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

Adapts to evolving cyber threats with unsupervised ML models that detect abnormal network behaviors.

Reduces false positives by learning from real-world network activity patterns.

Customizable threat scoring system to prioritize critical attacks.


### Instant Alerting & Automated Incident Response

Multi-channel notifications: Email, SMS, push alerts, and SIEM integrations.

Automated IP blocking and firewall rule enforcement to neutralize threats in real-time.

Incident playbooks with step-by-step guidance on containment and mitigation.


### Deep Packet Inspection & Network Traffic Analysis

Live packet capture and forensic investigation tools to analyze cyberattacks.

Visual insights into top attack sources, target systems, and affected protocols.

Full protocol analysis (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP, SSH, etc.) to expose hidden threats.


### Centralized Security Dashboard & Reports

Intuitive dashboard for monitoring cyber threats across multiple endpoints.

Advanced filtering & drill-down analytics to pinpoint vulnerabilities.

Automated reports for compliance audits (GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001).


### Enterprise-Grade Security & Customization

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage security team permissions.

Supports on-premise, cloud, and hybrid deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Fully customizable detection rules and response automation workflows.
